# globallogic
testing exercise for GlobalLogic 

- Import project on intelliJ IDEA 13.1+
- I used Maven to create and manage the project and Hamcrest Matchers for assertions
- Chromedriver path is set to E:/chromedriver/chromedriver.exe (this can be changed from chromeBaseTest, line 31)
- There are some obvious improvements that can be made for maintainability like separating test data and page objects into their own classes, but for the purpose of this exercise I chose to just have them in the same constants class.
