# globallogic
testing exercise for GlobalLogic 

- I used Maven for build management, JUnit and Hamcrest Matchers.
- CI platform used is Codeship
  - Go to https://codeship.com/projects/91201 and log in with the following credentials: test.globallogic1@gmail.com / guessme123
- I used IntelliJ IDEA 13.1 to develop and run locally.
- There are some obvious improvements that can be made for maintainability like separating test data and page objects into their own classes, but for the purpose of this exercise I chose to just have them in the same constants class.
